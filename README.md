## Description of cooking app
This cooking app allows users to browse a wide variety of recipes, add their own, and filter options based on available ingredients. By simply entering what you have at home, the app will suggest meals you can cook with those ingredients, making meal planning easier and reducing food waste. Additionally, the app features a built-in cooking assistant that guides users through each recipe step-by-step. Every step includes a timer to track the remaining time needed for that part of the preparation, ensuring the cooking process is smooth and stress-free.
